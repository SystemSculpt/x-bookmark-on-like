# Auto Bookmark on Like for X

## Goal

A Chrome extension that automatically bookmarks posts/tweets when you like them on X (formerly Twitter), with the ability to toggle this feature on/off. This saves you a click and makes liked content searchable via text in your bookmarks, unlike X's native liked-only tweets which aren't searchable.
